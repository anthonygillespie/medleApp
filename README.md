An anatomy focused Wordle clone made using Flutter

Figure out what the hidden anatomy term is by guessing combinations of letters in a heavily Wordle inspired game.

A couple things to remember:
1. Guesses don't need to be valid words in this version
2. If there are multiple copies of a letter in the solution, you can guess multiples of a letter and it will only color as many as there are in the solution
